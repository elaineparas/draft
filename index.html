        <p>Sumlang Lake is located in Barangay Sumlang, Camalig, Albay. The name of the barangay and lake was derived
          from bamboo shoots locally called “islang” that are common in the area harvested for food. The water area of
          the lake, wherein different flora and fauna and various fish species such as tilapia and fresh water shrimps
          can be found. Most of the residents of Barangay Sumlang engage in handicraft making and agriculture.</p>

          The Balsa Race, a unique water sports event that draws even more participants from the neighboring barangays,
          municipalities, cities, and visiting guests. Sumlang Lake became the venue of photography sessions, culinary
          and cooking demos and photo shoots, product showcase activities during the Pinangat Festival and Sumlang Lake
          Festival, and location shoots of some film productions.</p>
