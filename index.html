      <div class="history-item">
        <p>Sumlang Lake is located in Barangay Sumlang, Camalig, Albay. The name of the barangay and lake was derived
          from bamboo shoots locally called “islang” that are common in the area harvested for food. The water area of
          the lake, wherein different flora and fauna and various fish species such as tilapia and fresh water shrimps
          can be found. Most of the residents of Barangay Sumlang engage in handicraft making and agriculture.</p>

        <p>The Sumlang Barangay Council with the help of the Local Government Unit of Camalig initiated cleaning and
          dredging of water lilies at the lake last 2012 through food for work program. Since then, the barangay council
          created a working group composed of the local residents tasked to maintain the cleanliness of the lake.</p>

        <p>In the year 2013, the barangay and the local tourism office and stakeholders started promoting the place and
          attracting more visitors to try the balsa boating activity. Consequently, the LGU and the barangay conducted
          The Balsa Race, a unique water sports event that draws even more participants from the neighboring barangays,
          municipalities, cities, and visiting guests. Sumlang Lake became the venue of photography sessions, culinary
          and cooking demos and photo shoots, product showcase activities during the Pinangat Festival and Sumlang Lake
          Festival, and location shoots of some film productions.</p>

        <p>There was a decline in number of tourists visiting the lake due to the effect of the pandemic from 2020 up to

          beauty of Mayon Volcano and the serene lake that lies in its shadow. This influx of visitors created a vibrant
          local economy, with new establishments sprouting up to cater to the growing demand. Local artisans also saw an
          opportunity to showcase their crafts, selling handmade goods that reflected the region's rich cultural
          heritage.
